# poverty_mapping-stanford_ai4all
 
This project was done at Stanford AI4ALL, a 3-week summer program. It was down over the last two weeks of the program. The structure was set up by my mentors. The parts that I coded include: 
  project/project: experiment_helpers, model_helpers, model
  project/utils: model_tester
