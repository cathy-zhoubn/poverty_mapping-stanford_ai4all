# poverty_mapping-stanford_ai4all
 
This project was completed at Stanford AI4ALL, a three-week summer program. It was done over the last two weeks of the program. (https://ai4all.spcs.stanford.edu/)


The structure was set up by my mentors. The parts that I coded include: 

  project/project: experiment_helpers, model_helpers, model
  
  project/utils: model_tester


Other parts of the code are given by my mentors. This project was done by a group of 8. However, each of us worked on our own code but communicated with each other while we worked on the project.
